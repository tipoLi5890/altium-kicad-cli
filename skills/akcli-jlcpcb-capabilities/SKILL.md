  Consult 嘉立創/JLC (jlc.com) manufacturing capabilities — the PRIMARY reference —
  while designing a board: rigid PCB (1-64 layers, HDI blind/buried vias, 0.1 mm
  microvias, up to 6 oz copper), FPC, and SMT assembly limits with exact numbers,
  plus a JLCPCB-international (jlcpcb.com) difference table and stencil specs. Use
  this skill whenever the task involves: choosing trace width/spacing, via or drill
  sizes, board size/thickness, copper weight, solder mask or silkscreen limits;
  checking whether a package (0201/0402, BGA pitch, fine-pitch IC) is assemblable;
  Economic vs Standard SMT; panelization (V-cut, 郵票孔, process borders, Mark
  points); flex stackups, coverlay, stiffeners; stencil ordering; or preparing /
  exporting Gerber+drill files for a JLC order (出圖, RS-274-X, layer mapping,

# akcli-jlcpcb-capabilities — 嘉立創/JLC manufacturer limits to design against

嘉立創/JLC is the **primary manufacturing reference** while designing a board.
This file holds the **judgment** (what to decide at schematic/layout time) and
the **handoff procedure**; the exhaustive capability numbers live in
`references/`, loaded on demand (see the index at the bottom).

**Sources**: 工藝能力頁 <https://www.jlc.com/portal/vtechnology.html> +
出圖/DFM 指導 <https://www.jlc.com/portal/server_guide_112.html> — extracted
2026-07-06, re-verified 2026-07-15. All numbers are a **point-in-time
snapshot**: for anything order-critical or borderline, confirm against the live
page and the order-time DFM/audit result.

## First decision: which service line?

**嘉立創 (jlc.com, domestic CN) and JLCPCB (jlcpcb.com, international) are the
same company but DIFFERENT service lines with different limits** — pick the one
the user will actually order from. The differences that change a design:

| Item | 嘉立創 jlc.com | JLCPCB intl |
|---|---|---|
| Max layers | **64** | 32 |
| Blind/buried vias (HDI) | **supported (4–32 L)** | not supported |
| Microvia | **0.1 mm** | 0.15 mm min |
| Outer copper (2-layer) | up to **6 oz** | up to 4.5 oz |
| Thickness | 0.4–**4.8 mm** | 0.4–4.5 mm |
| Standard-SMT min BGA pitch | **0.3 mm** | 0.35 mm |

Full delta in `references/jlcpcb-international.md`. **HDI / blind-buried vias
exist ONLY on 嘉立創 — if the design needs them and the user might order
internationally, that is a blocker to surface early.**

## How to apply this while drawing

- **At schematic time (akcli's territory), assembly limits bite first**: pick
  packages the SMT line can place — Economic 經濟型 ≥0402 / IC pitch ≥0.4 mm /
  BGA ≥0.5 mm; Standard 標準型 ≥0201 / 0.35 mm / 0.3 mm (adds a required 5 mm
  process border). Prefer Basic/Preferred parts (`akcli jlc search`,
  akcli-parts-sourcing skill). Full table: `references/assembly-and-stencil.md`.
- **Comfortable defaults vs absolute limits**: an ordinary 1 oz 2–4 layer board
  at ≥0.127 mm (5 mil) trace/space and 0.3/0.6 mm vias sits far inside every
  limit at zero cost. Quote the limit values (0.09 mm trace, 0.15/0.25 mm via,
  0.1 mm microvia) only for dense BGA fan-out, and label them as limits.
- **Copper weight rewrites the rules**: 2 oz → 0.16/0.16 mm trace/space and
  0.20 mm mask dam; 6 oz → 0.45/0.45 mm. Re-check every clearance for heavy
  copper. Full trace/space + via tables: `references/rigid-pcb.md`.
- **Black/white mask is coarser** (0.13 vs 0.10 mm dam @1 oz) — prefer green for
  dense fine-pitch.

## Manufacturing handoff — the four order artifacts from KiCad

A JLCPCB PCBA order needs Gerbers + drill + BOM + CPL. The BOM comes straight
from akcli; the rest from `kicad-cli` (headless, agent-runnable — flags
verified on KiCad 10; DRC gate first, always):

```bash
kicad-cli pcb drc board.kicad_pcb --exit-code-violations
kicad-cli pcb export gerbers board.kicad_pcb -o fab/ \
  --layers F.Cu,B.Cu,F.Paste,B.Paste,F.Silkscreen,B.Silkscreen,F.Mask,B.Mask,Edge.Cuts \
  --subtract-soldermask                # multilayer: add In1.Cu,In2.Cu,...
kicad-cli pcb export drill board.kicad_pcb -o fab/ --format excellon \
  --drill-origin absolute --excellon-units mm --excellon-zeros-format decimal --generate-map
kicad-cli pcb export pos board.kicad_pcb -o fab/cpl.csv --format csv --units mm \
  --side both --exclude-dnp
akcli jlc bom board.kicad_sch --qty 10 --csv fab/bom.csv   # JLCPCB header, LCSC ids
akcli fab check board.kicad_pcb --profile jlc-4l-1oz.toml --order order.toml
akcli fab explain FAB_VIA_IN_PAD --profile jlc-4l-1oz.toml
```

A fab profile (`--profile`) is a versioned vendor-capability snapshot — `[source]`
URLs plus a `retrieved_at` date, see `examples/fab/jlc-4l-1oz.toml` — that turns this
skill's capability numbers into a machine-checkable gate: `fab check` runs the
board against it (and, with `--order`, against the declared purchase intent) and
classifies findings by severity — direct rule violations are errors, cost-driving
thresholds are warnings, boundary-exact values are notes. `fab explain <CODE>` prints
the rule, the fix direction, and the evidence behind a specific finding code. For the
free-vs-paid **via covering** model, the surcharge triggers, the capability→profile-field
mapping, and **exactly what `fab check` gates vs what stays advisory** (it is a
fab-policy/cost gate, NOT a geometric DRC — pair it with `kicad-cli pcb drc`), see
`references/cost-and-fab-profile.md`.

CPL header rename before upload: `Ref→Designator, PosX→Mid X, PosY→Mid Y,
Rot→Rotation, Side→Layer` (or use JLCPCB's Fabrication Toolkit KiCad plugin /
the order page's column mapper). **Always check the placement preview for
polarized-part rotation** — it is the classic PCBA defect. GUI walkthroughs:
JLCPCB's own KiCad 8 guides

[BOM/centroid](https://jlcpcb.com/hk/help/article/generate-bom-and-centroid-files-from-kicad-8));
full detail in `docs/jlc.md`.

## DFM & 出圖 — the mistakes that scrap a first batch

Top rules an agent must get right (full file-prep guide + the nine 常見錯誤:
`references/dfm-and-file-prep.md`):

- **RS-274-X Gerber only** (JLC 域内 rejects Gerber X2 / RS-274-D); KiCad's
  default output is RS-274-X.
- **Outline + slots on `Edge.Cuts` as real geometry**; **mask windows come from
  `*.Mask`, not `*.Paste`** (paste = stencil only).
- **No silkscreen on a pad** (JLC deletes it); never hand-mirror bottom text —
  KiCad already mirrors it.
- **Plated vs non-plated is load-bearing** — a mis-marked hole is a silent open /
  an unsolderable pin. Verify PTH/NPTH before export.
- **Declare special intent** — controlled impedance and a multi-design panel's
  design count are NOT in the files; put them in `order.toml` and gate with
  `akcli fab check --order`.
- **First batch is customer-verified — no refund on artwork errors** — run
  `kicad-cli pcb drc` + `akcli fab check` and review the placement/mask preview
  before ordering.

## Caveats (repeat when advising)

- Snapshot **2026-07-06** (capabilities) / **2026-07-15** (DFM + re-verify); the
  live 工藝能力 page and order-time audit are authoritative. 嘉立創 revises
  frequently (e.g. the 2025-06 LDI mask-1:1 change).
- Tables mix **建議值 (recommended)** and **極限值 (absolute limits)** — when
  quoting a limit, say it is a limit, not a target.
- Special processes (HDI, microvia, heavy copper, backdrill, via fill, 6+
  layers, high-frequency, impedance) change price class; 沉金 (ENIG) is often
  mandatory for the extreme values.
- These are layout/fab constraints; akcli's checks are schematic-level. Gate
  component choice at schematic time; for hard, CI-grade gating on an actual
  board file use `akcli fab check --profile` (versioned and sourced) rather than
  eyeballing the tables.
