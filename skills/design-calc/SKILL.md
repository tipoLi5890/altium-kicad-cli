# design-calc — standards-backed calculators for circuit design

Never do component-value math "from memory": run `akcli calc` and read the
answer **with its citation**. Every result prints the formal source (standard,
datasheet, or textbook) the formula comes from.

```
akcli calc list                 # all calculators, grouped
akcli calc info <name>          # parameters, defaults, the reference
akcli calc <name> k=v ... [--json]
```

Inputs accept engineering notation: `4k7`, `100n`, `35u`, `2M2`, `1e-7`.
`--json` returns `{calc, inputs, results{value,unit,note}, reference}`.

**Input-suffix rule — already-milli units take a bare number.** When a
parameter's declared unit is itself milli-denominated (`battery-life`'s
`capacity` in **mAh**, `i_avg` in **mA**), pass the plain datasheet number:
`battery-life capacity=2500 i_avg=10` means 2500 mAh @ 10 mA. A trailing
engineering `m` there is **rejected** (`ERROR: capacity is already in mAh —
write capacity=2500`) rather than silently applying a compounding 1000× milli.
The generic length unit `m` (meters) is unaffected — `width=5m` still means
5 mm via the milli prefix. (`battery-life`'s default `derating` is 0.8, aligned
with `battery`; override with `derating=`.)

**Deliberately missing:** IPC-2152 track current — chart-based licensed
measurement data with no public closed form; this tool refuses to fake it.
Say so when a user asks, and use the conservative IPC-2221 fit
(`trackwidth`/`tracktemp`) instead.

## Tooling

- `akcli calc batch jobs.json` — `{"jobs":[{"calc":...,"params":{...}}]}` in,
  envelope array out; exit 1 if any job failed. Use for sweeps.
- `--md` — paste-ready markdown result table for reports.
- `--ops out.json` — design-type calculators (`vdivider-design`,
  `regulator-design`, `led`, `i2c-pullup`, `crystal-caps`, `hysteresis-design`,
  `sallen-key`, `attenuator`) emit a valid `place_component` op-list with the
  computed standard values filled in: edit coordinates, `akcli plan`, then
  `draw`.
- `akcli view calc` — local web UI (localhost) with SVG illustrations,
  pinned/recent lists and shareable URLs, for humans reviewing your numbers.

## Workflow integration (this is the point)

1. **Before placing a passive** in an op-list (`akcli draw`/`plan`), compute it
   (`vdivider-design`, `led`, `regulator-design`, ...) and use the
   `*_standard` E-series value as the component's `value` field — never the
   ideal number.
2. **During schematic review**, check suspicious values: a resistor that
   `eseries` cannot match within ~1 % on E96 is likely a typo or a
   special-order part — flag it.
3. **Manufacturability**: compare `trackwidth`/`clearance` results against the
   fab's minimums (see the jlcpcb-capabilities skill) and state both numbers
   in the report.
4. **Cite the source** in any human-facing recommendation — the `reference`
   field is part of the answer, copy it.
5. **Calculator inputs come from the datasheet, not folklore.** Pull the PDF
   first (`akcli jlc datasheet <C-number> --fetch`, then read it): LED V_F
   from the electrical-characteristics table (not "2.0 V"), LDO V_DO into
   `ldo-headroom`, comparator thresholds vs the input common-mode limit,
   battery capacity at the actual load current. Prefer table values; read
   curves for trends only, and say which table row you used.

## Honesty rules

- Transmission-line numbers (`microstrip`/`stripline`) are closed-form
  estimates (zero trace thickness); for production impedance control defer to
  the fab's field solver and say so.
- `fusing`, `battery`, and `battery-life` are explicitly advisory estimates
  — never size protection or promise runtime from them without margin.
- IPC-2221 track-width is the conservative classic; IPC-2152 measured data
  allows narrower traces. If the layout is tight, mention that.
- Worst-case regulator output (`regulator` with `vref_min/max`, `tol`) is a
  full corner enumeration; quote min/max, not just typ.

Numerical behavior is cross-checked in the test suite against KiCad's
pcb_calculator (independent implementation, no code shared) and against
published datasheet/handbook values — see `tests/test_calc.py`.
