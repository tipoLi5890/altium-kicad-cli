# design-calc — standards-backed calculators for circuit design

Never do component-value math "from memory": run `akcli calc` and read the
answer **with its citation**. Every result prints the formal source (standard,
datasheet, or textbook) the formula comes from.

```
akcli calc list                 # all calculators, grouped
akcli calc info <name>          # parameters, defaults, the reference
akcli calc <name> k=v ... [--json]
```

Inputs accept engineering notation: `4k7`, `100n`, `35u`, `2M2`, `1e-7`.
`--json` returns `{calc, inputs, results{value,unit,note}, reference}`.

## When to reach for which calculator

| Design moment | Calculator | Source of the formula |
|---|---|---|
| Any resistor/cap value you are about to place | `eseries` (snap to E24/E96) | IEC 60063:2015 |
| Value not purchasable → synthesize from 2–4 parts | `rcombo` | IEC 60063 pool |
| Divider for ADC/FB sensing | `vdivider`, `vdivider-design` | Horowitz & Hill 3rd ed. |
| LM317 / LDO / switcher feedback | `regulator`, `regulator-design` | TI SLVS044Y (LM317) |
| LED current limiting | `led` | Ohm's law + IEC 60063 |
| RC/LC filters, debounce, timing | `rc`, `rc-charge`, `lc`, `reactance` | Horowitz & Hill 3rd ed. |
| Trace must carry X amps | `trackwidth`, `trackcurrent` | IPC-2221B §6.2 |
| HV spacing between nets | `clearance` | IPC-2221B Table 6-1 |
| Via good enough for this current / this edge rate? | `via` | IPC-2221B; Johnson & Graham 1993 |
| Will this trace/wire survive a fault? | `fusing` | Onderdonk (1928), Preece (1884) |
| Wire gauge for off-board cabling | `awg` | ASTM B258-18 |
| Controlled impedance estimate | `microstrip`, `stripline`, `coax`, `twinlead` | Hammerstad–Jensen 1980; Cohn 1954; Pozar |
| Pad/attenuate an RF signal | `attenuator` | Ref. Data for Radio Engineers 6th ed. |
| Buck/boost L, ripple, C_out | `buck`, `boost` | TI SLVA477B / SLVA372C |
| 555 timer RC values | `ne555-astable`, `ne555-mono` | TI SLFS022I datasheet |

| MCU crystal C1/C2 | `crystal-caps` | ST AN2867 |
| Will it overheat / need a heatsink? | `thermal` | JEDEC JESD51-2A |
| Battery runtime | `battery` | rule of thumb (advisory) |
| Read/print a resistor marking | `rescolor`, `smdcode` | IEC 60062:2016; EIA-96 |
| Dissimilar-metal contact (connector plating) | `galvanic` | MIL-STD-889C |

## Workflow integration (this is the point)

1. **Before placing a passive** in an op-list (`akcli draw`/`plan`), compute it
   (`vdivider-design`, `led`, `regulator-design`, ...) and use the
   `*_standard` E-series value as the component's `value` field — never the
   ideal number.
2. **During schematic review**, check suspicious values: a resistor that
   `eseries` cannot match within ~1 % on E96 is likely a typo or a
   special-order part — flag it.
3. **Manufacturability**: compare `trackwidth`/`clearance` results against the
   fab's minimums (see the jlcpcb-capabilities skill) and state both numbers
   in the report.
4. **Cite the source** in any human-facing recommendation — the `reference`
   field is part of the answer, copy it.

## Honesty rules

- Transmission-line numbers (`microstrip`/`stripline`) are closed-form
  estimates (zero trace thickness); for production impedance control defer to
  the fab's field solver and say so.
- `fusing` and `battery` are explicitly advisory estimates — never size
  protection from them without margin.
- IPC-2221 track-width is the conservative classic; IPC-2152 measured data
  allows narrower traces. If the layout is tight, mention that.
- Worst-case regulator output (`regulator` with `vref_min/max`, `tol`) is a
  full corner enumeration; quote min/max, not just typ.

Numerical behavior is cross-checked in the test suite against KiCad's
pcb_calculator (independent implementation, no code shared) and against
published datasheet/handbook values — see `tests/test_calc.py`.
