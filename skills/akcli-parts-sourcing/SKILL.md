# akcli-parts-sourcing — driving `akcli jlc` for JLCPCB/LCSC search and BOM hygiene

`akcli jlc` searches the JLCPCB / LCSC catalog (via the public jlcsearch service). It is
the **only networked `akcli` feature** — every other command runs fully offline. For
plain schematic read/analyze/draw mechanics (formats, op-list rules, exit-code legend,
config discovery), **see the akcli-circuit-design skill**; this skill covers only the
sourcing loop.

## Core sourcing principles (follow these)

- **Prefer Basic (`B`) parts, then Preferred (`P`).** Extended parts add per-reel assembly
  fees at JLCPCB. Surface the stock count with every recommendation — a perfect part with
  0 stock is not sourced.
- **Compare at the build quantity.** The `--json` output carries the full
  `price_tiers` ladder; the headline price is the lowest-`qFrom` tier only.
- **Check assemblability before falling in love with a package.** JLCPCB's PCBA line
  has hard minimums (0402/0201, BGA pitch, pin pitch) — see the akcli-jlcpcb-capabilities skill.
- **The schematic is authoritative.** Record every sourcing decision on the schematic
  (an `LCSC` parameter per designator), never only in a side document.
- **A downloaded datasheet can become audited facts** — after `jlc datasheet`
  fetches the PDF, the akcli-datasheet-facts skill extracts its numbers into
  `datasheets/extracted/` (sha256+page pinned) so `akcli review analyze`
  upgrades findings to datasheet_backed. Source → PDF → facts is one chain.
- **Read the datasheet before committing a part** — electrical characteristics, absolute
  maximum ratings and the typical application circuit come from the PDF, not from memory
  (step 4 below).
- **Never manually `sed` the fp-lib-table or a symbol's Footprint field.** Run
  `akcli library audit <project>` to find `FOOTPRINT_LIB_UNREGISTERED`, then fix it with
  `akcli library repair <project> --rename-footprint-lib OLD=NEW --apply` — hand edits drift
  out of sync with the schematic and the 3D models.

## Workflow

### (1) Search — find candidate parts

```bash
akcli jlc search NE555                     # keyword search (default 20 results)
akcli jlc search NE555 --limit 5
akcli jlc search "0603 100nF" --json       # machine-readable part objects
akcli jlc show C7593                       # one part by LCSC C-number (bare 7593 also works)
akcli jlc show C2040 --easyeda             # + 3D/STEP availability, EasyEDA manufacturer/MPN/package
```

The query matches MPN, category, and C-number. Text output is a table
(`LCSC  MPN  PACKAGE  STOCK  PRICE  B  DESCRIPTION`) where the `B` column is `B` for a JLCPCB
**Basic** part, `P` for **Preferred**, `-` otherwise. `--json` part fields: `lcsc`, `mpn`,
`package`, `stock`, `price` (lowest-`qFrom` tier as a float, or `null`), `basic`, `datasheet`,
`category`, and `attributes` (with `subcategory`, `is_preferred`, and the full
`price_tiers` `[{qFrom,qTo,price},...]` ladder). Compare candidates on stock, price tier at the
build quantity, and Basic status — not just the first hit.

No results is exit `0` with a stderr notice; network/HTTP failures exit `7` with one
`ERROR: NETWORK: ...` line. `--easyeda` is best-effort: on failure it prints
`(metadata unavailable)` and never breaks the command.

### (2) Convert — turn a C-number into a KiCad library

```bash
akcli jlc add C2040                                   # symbol + footprint
akcli jlc add C2040 --3d                              # + 3D STEP model
akcli jlc add C2040 --out ./mylib --lib-name akcli --force
akcli jlc add C2040 --footprint-lib proj_jlc --3d-path relative
```

`--footprint-lib NICKNAME` sets the fp-lib-table nickname written into the symbol's
Footprint field (and the footprint output directory) — the default hardcoded `footprint`
is the **#1 cause of "KiCad can't find footprint"**; set it to the nickname your
project's fp-lib-table actually registers. `--3d-path {relative|absolute|'${VAR}'}`
is a portability trade-off: `relative` (default) only resolves next to the library,
`absolute` always resolves on this machine but breaks on another, and a `${VAR}`
prefix resolves portably via a KiCad path variable.

Conversion runs **in-process** (vendored MIT JLC2KiCadLib core — no external
binary). Output layout: `symbol/<lib-name>.kicad_sym`,
`footprint/<name>.kicad_mod`, `footprint/packages3d/<name>.step` (with `--3d`).
Exit codes: `0` success, `2` bad usage, `4` part has no EasyEDA CAD data,
`6` conversion failed/empty, `7` network error.

**A converted library is a claim, not a fact.** Verify before wiring in:
1. **Pin count vs datasheet** — `akcli read <out>/symbol/<lib>.kicad_sym` must match
   the package drawing exactly; spot-check power/ground/pin-1 in `--json`.
2. **Footprint keying** — check pin-1 marking, pad numbering and courtyard against
   the datasheet land pattern (read the `.kicad_mod` or view it in KiCad).

### (3) Place and close the BOM loop

`--place` emits a one-op `place_component` op-list (`place.json`) with `lib_id`
read from the produced `.kicad_sym` — never guessed from filenames:

```bash
akcli jlc add C2040 --out ./mylib --place --designator U1 --at 1000 1500
akcli draw board.kicad_sch --ops ./mylib/place.json --symbols ./mylib/symbol/akcli.kicad_sym          # dry-run first
akcli draw board.kicad_sch --ops ./mylib/place.json --symbols ./mylib/symbol/akcli.kicad_sym --apply
akcli check board.kicad_sch --bom              # dup designators, refdes gaps, missing value/footprint
akcli component board.kicad_sch U1             # confirm the placed part's pin -> net map
```

- **Missing value/footprint findings:** fix via a `set_component_parameters` op (fields:
  `designator` required; optional `value`, `footprint`, `parameters`) applied with
  `akcli plan` / `akcli draw --apply` — see the akcli-circuit-design skill for op-list mechanics.
- **Match designators to sourced parts:** record each designator's LCSC C-number (e.g. as an
  `LCSC` entry in the op's `parameters` object) so the fabrication BOM maps `R10 -> C25804`
  unambiguously. Re-run `akcli check board.kicad_sch --bom` after every edit; it exits `1`
  while findings remain (`--exit-zero` for report mode).
- After any `--apply`, re-read (`akcli read` / `akcli net`) to confirm the write — never assume.
- Run `akcli library audit <project>` to cross-check sym/fp-lib-table ↔ schematic ↔ footprint ↔
  3D. Fix any `FOOTPRINT_LIB_UNREGISTERED`/`MODEL_MISSING` finding with
  `akcli library repair <project> --rename-footprint-lib OLD=NEW --3d-path absolute --apply`
  (leaves a `.bak`, then re-audits) instead of manual `sed`.

### (4) Datasheets — resolve, fetch, read, verify

```bash
akcli jlc datasheet C2984661                  # resolve: PDF URL + MPN + manufacturer
akcli jlc datasheet C2984661 --fetch          # download -> ~/.cache/akcli/datasheets/
akcli jlc datasheet board.kicad_sch --fetch   # every BOM line with an LCSC id, one run
akcli jlc datasheet board.kicad_sch --resolve-mpn --fetch  # MPN-only lines: catalog lookup first
```

- Links come from the part's **EasyEDA record** (szlcsc-hosted PDF; the jlcsearch
  mirror carries none, and lcsc.com bot-gates plain downloads). `--fetch` verifies
  the `%PDF` magic — an HTML challenge page is reported as `fetch-failed`, never
  saved as a broken `.pdf`. Existing files are the cache; `--force` refetches.
- Only direct `.pdf` links are fetched; a `page-link` row keeps the product/
  viewer URL — fetch THAT with a browser-grade fetcher (WebFetch) to locate the
  PDF. `no-link` rows print the LCSC product-page hint. Either way the fastest
  fallback is the **manufacturer's own site** — original-vendor PDFs
  (vishay.com, ti.com, onsemi.com, ...) download fine with plain curl.
- **Read in chunks** (PDF readers cap ~20 pages/request; the tables live early):
  absolute maximum ratings -> recommended operating conditions -> electrical
  characteristics -> typical application circuit. Feed table values into
  `akcli calc` inputs (akcli-design-calc skill rule 5) and margin-check the placed
  circuit against the absolute-max column. Quote the table row (symbol,
  condition, min/typ/max) in the report so review can retrace it.
- **Datasheet → SPICE model (diodes).** A forward-voltage table row also feeds
  `akcli sim fit-diode --point 0.37@20m --n-prior 1.05` (a Schottky prior), which
  fits a `.model` and can write `Sim.Device`/`Sim.Params` straight onto the part
  (`--apply <sch> --designator D1 --write`) — turning a sourced diode into a
  simulatable one. See `docs/sim.md` and the akcli-design-calc skill.
- Batch mode surfaces `no-lcsc` lines — pin C-numbers first with
  `jlc bom --suggest/--fix`, then re-run.
- **Live dashboard BOM links:** when `akcli view live <sch>` runs its networked
  BOM check (`?check=1`), each priced line with an LCSC id gains an inline
  **datasheet link** (resolved via the same EasyEDA path as `jlc datasheet`;
  direct PDFs and page-links get distinct glyphs). It is per-line
  failure-tolerant and absent on the offline BOM — a fast way to eyeball
  coverage while reviewing the board.

## When NOT to use this skill

- **Parts with no LCSC listing** (`jlc show` returns a `no part ... found` notice): there is no
  Digi-Key/Mouser/Octopart client in `akcli`. Source from the vendor and flag for human review.
- **Controlled, long-lead, or supply-critical parts** (automotive-qualified, ITAR, allocated
  MCUs): JLCPCB stock is a point-in-time snapshot, not a procurement commitment. Flag these for
  human sourcing instead of relying on `stock > 0`.
- **Offline environments:** `jlc` is the only networked subcommand; everything else in `akcli`
  still works. Without network, `jlc search`/`jlc show` exit `7`.

## Exit codes (jlc family)

`0` success, including clean no-results (stderr notice) · `1` lint-style problems
(`jlc bom` stock/id problems; `jlc datasheet` not-found/no-link/fetch-failed) ·
`2` usage error · `7` network error. Full legend and error-line format: see the
akcli-circuit-design skill.
