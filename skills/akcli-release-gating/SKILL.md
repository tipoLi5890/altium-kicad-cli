  Gate a hardware release with `akcli release preflight` — every gate, a
  traceable manifest, and the governance for letting review findings block
  (calibrated allowlist policy). Use this skill whenever the task involves:
  releasing/ordering/taping out a board; running or interpreting release
  preflight; authoring a `--review-policy` allowlist; checking a fab (gerber)
  package before ordering; or deciding whether a finding may block CI.
  Triggers on: release, preflight, tape-out, order the board, 放行, 出貨,

# akcli-release-gating — one gate run, one traceable manifest

`release preflight` runs every applicable gate and writes a manifest binding
input hashes, tool versions, git state and each gate's findings. PASS means
every gate passed; skipped gates are recorded WITH their reason — a skipped
gate is visible, never silent.

```bash
akcli release preflight --sch board.kicad_sch --pcb board.kicad_pcb --fab-profile fab.toml --gerbers fab/ --contract contract.toml --review-policy policy.toml --out release.manifest.json
```

Gates, in order: `check` (ERC/power/BOM/nets) → `intent` → `contract` →
`library-audit` → `sch-pcb` → `fab` → `order` → **`review`** (policy-gated)
→ **`gerber`** (fab package) → `git` (clean worktree; `--allow-dirty`
records instead of failing).

## Gate doctrine

- **Give every input you have.** Each omitted flag is a skipped gate; the
  report and manifest say so, and your release summary must repeat the
  skipped list — "PASS with 4 gates skipped" is the honest sentence.
- **The manifest is the artifact.** Always pass `--out`; the manifest's
  sha256-bound inputs are what makes the release auditable later.
- **A FAIL is findings, not a tool error** (exit 1 = findings, per-gate
  detail in the output). Fix or explicitly waive (with reason) — never
  re-run with fewer inputs to make it pass.

## The review gate — blocking is earned, not default

Review findings are ADVISORY everywhere else. The ONLY path by which one
blocks a release is an explicit policy file:

```toml
# policy.toml
[review]
profile = "standard"
allow = ["REVIEW_PCB_UNROUTED", "REVIEW_FB_DIVIDER_VREF_MISMATCH", "REVIEW_GERBER_STALE"]
```

Rules you enforce when authoring or reviewing a policy:

- **Only calibrated codes enter `allow`.** The promotion path is: replay a
  corpus of real boards (`python tools/corpus_replay.py CORPUS_DIR
  --write-baseline base.json`, dev checkout only) → measure the
  false-positive rate on boards known good → only then allowlist. Never
  allowlist a `heuristic`-confidence rule that has not been through this —
  a false blocker destroys trust in the whole gate.
- Start from `deterministic` rules (`REVIEW_PCB_UNROUTED`,
  `REVIEW_GERBER_*`) and `datasheet_backed` rules; they are recomputable
  facts, not judgements.
- An empty/missing `allow` list is a USAGE error by design — a policy that
  blocks on "everything" is not a policy.
- The policy file's sha256 + allow list land in the manifest
  (`inputs.review_policy`) — a release is auditable against WHICH rules were
  allowed to block it.
- Facts auto-load from `<sch dir>/datasheets/` — a well-stocked facts store
  (akcli-datasheet-facts skill) makes the gated rules `datasheet_backed`.

## The gerber gate — never order a stale package

```bash
akcli release preflight --sch board.kicad_sch --pcb board.kicad_pcb --gerbers fab/ --allow-dirty --out release.manifest.json
```

With `--gerbers` the package is checked for: the minimum fab set (copper ×2,
masks, outline, plated drill; missing silk is a note), copper-file count vs
the board's declared stackup, layer registration (per-layer extent alignment —
unrelated to the `akcli bbox` symbol-placement subcommand), mixed units, and
**staleness** — the outline gerber's size vs the board file's Edge.Cuts
extent. `REVIEW_GERBER_STALE` means the export predates the last board edit:
re-export, never ship. This is the "ordered the old rev" failure, caught
mechanically.

## Reporting a release decision

Close with a verdict backed by the manifest:

- **GO** — every gate PASS; list skipped gates and why they are acceptable
  for THIS release (e.g. no order manifest because the fab takes gerbers
  directly).
- **NO-GO** — quote the failing gate's findings verbatim (code + message);
  map each to its fix path (`review propose` for value fixes → the
  akcli-schematic-authoring skill; re-export for gerber staleness; commit
  for a dirty worktree).
- Never present "PASS with `--allow-dirty`" as a clean release — the
  manifest records the dirty worktree; your summary must too.

## When NOT to use this skill

- Running a design review (findings, not gating) → akcli-schematic-review.
- JLC manufacturability/cost questions → akcli-jlcpcb-capabilities; fab
  profile authoring lives with `akcli fab explain`.
- Fixing what a gate caught → akcli-schematic-authoring (proposal adoption).
