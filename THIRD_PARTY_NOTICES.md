# Third-Party Notices

`altium-kicad-cli` is licensed under the MIT License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)) and ships **zero bundled
third-party source code**. It has **no runtime dependencies** (Python standard library only).

This file records the **attribution chain** for projects that were used as **independent-design
references** — that is, for high-level *patterns* only. To be precise about provenance:

> **Independent reimplementation; no source copied; attribution retained where structures are
> referenced.** No source files, and no schema bytes, were copied from any project below. Our JSON
> Schema `$id`, titles, `ERROR` enum, and `protocol_version` field are original to this project.

## Provenance of the ported Altium parser logic

The OLE2/CFBF container-reading approach and the Altium record framing / `|KEY=VALUE|` field tokenizer
were **ported from the author's own prior work** and **relicensed by the same author** from a
proprietary header to MIT for this project. The net-naming
defect in that prior code was deliberately **not** reused; the net layer was rebuilt. This is
first-party material and is covered by this repository's MIT LICENSE; it is listed here only for a
complete provenance record.

## Attribution chain — Altium MCP pattern reference

The optional Windows live-bridge design (`drivers/altium_live/`) and the structured `ERROR: CODE`
convention were informed, as an **independent-design reference for high-level patterns only**, by the
Altium MCP lineage:

- **flaco-source / altium-mcp** (2026) — file-based JSON request/response bridge between an external
  process and a running Altium instance; a `protocol_version` field on the bridge protocol; structured
  `ERROR: CODE` response strings. Referenced for *concept*, not code.
- **coffeenmusic** and **Siddharth Ahuja** (2025) — earlier Altium scripting / MCP work that the above
  builds upon, providing the DelphiScript-drives-Altium pattern.

Patterns referenced (no source copied): a file-based JSON bridge with atomic request/response files; a
protocol-version handshake; structured machine-readable error strings. Everything in this repository
implementing those patterns — the schema namespace, the error-code registry, the op-list vocabulary,
the bridge directory/locking scheme, and all code — is original to this project.

## JLC/EasyEDA fetch + convert (subprocess / service; no source vendored)

## Vendored third-party source — JLC2KiCadLib (MIT)

`src/altium_kicad_cli/_vendor/jlc2kicadlib/` contains the conversion core of
**JLC2KiCadLib** by **TousstNicolas**, vendored under its MIT license
(<https://github.com/TousstNicolas/JLC2KiCad_lib>, commit `48d36032…`; the
upstream LICENSE is preserved verbatim in that directory and reproduced below,
and every local modification is listed in its `PROVENANCE.md`). It powers
`akcli jlc add` (LCSC → KiCad symbol/footprint/3D), running in-process.

Deliberately **not** vendored: upstream's two dependencies. `requests` is
replaced by a stdlib shim, and the **GPLv3 `KicadModTree`** footprint writer is
replaced by `_kmt.py` — an original, clean-room implementation of the small API
surface the vendored files use, written against the public KiCad footprint file
format (KicadModTree source was neither copied nor consulted). This keeps the
project MIT-licensed and free of copyleft obligations.

## Network services

Beyond the vendored code above, `altium-kicad-cli` bundles no third-party
source. The `jlc` feature queries the following HTTP services over the network.

### jlcsearch (tscircuit) — MIT

Public search service over the JLCPCB/LCSC catalog, queried by `akcli jlc search`/`show`.
<https://github.com/tscircuit/jlcsearch>. (MIT text reproduced below.)

### jlcparts — MIT

Open dataset/tooling behind the catalog data. <https://github.com/yaqwsx/jlcparts>.
(MIT text reproduced below.)

### EasyEDA / LCSC / JLCPCB — data source (not a code dependency)

`akcli jlc show` performs a light, read-only metadata + 3D-availability lookup against
EasyEDA's **unofficial** Std-editor REST backend (`easyeda.com/api/products/...`,
`modules.easyeda.com/...`). These endpoints are undocumented and may change without notice;
they are the same backend the `easyeda2kicad.py` project (uPesy, GPL/community) documents.
We do not vendor easyeda2kicad and do not reuse its conversion code — conversion is
queried directly (part metadata, and CAD documents for `jlc add`). EasyEDA, LCSC, and JLCPCB are trademarks of their respective owners;
this project is not affiliated with or endorsed by them.
