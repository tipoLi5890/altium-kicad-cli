"""Ground plane / stackup review (EMC batches 1 & 3).

Return currents follow the path of least loop area; a multilayer board
without a ground pour, a pour covering little of the outline, or two signal
layers facing each other without a reference between them all widen return
loops — the primary radiated-emission mechanism.
