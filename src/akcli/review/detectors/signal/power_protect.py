"""Power-entry protection review: input fusing + reverse-polarity.

A rail that arrives from OUTSIDE the board (battery, DC jack, VBUS) is walked
as a series chain (crossing only fuses, diodes and inductors — never
resistors or capacitors, so the walk cannot wander into dividers or
decoupling) and judged for a series fuse/PTC and a reverse-polarity element.
Fuse sizing is judged through ``calc fuse-derating`` (Littelfuse Fuseology,
IEC 60127 R10 ladder) and only when the facts store records the continuous
load current — never from a guessed load.

Honesty: entry nets are recognised by NAME tokens and parts by
designator/library keywords, so an unrecognised scheme (P-FET ideal-diode
controllers, exotic naming) is a false positive to waive — every finding says
so. Series-diode ORIENTATION is not checked (the schematic does not say which
chain end is the source), and that assumption is stated on the finding.
