"""Decoupling-capacitor placement review: cap-to-pin distance on power nets.

A decoupling cap only works close to the pin it decouples — loop inductance
grows with distance. Roles come from designator prefixes (C decouples U/Q),
so the judgement is honestly ``heuristic``; the distance itself is measured
geometry carried in the evidence.
