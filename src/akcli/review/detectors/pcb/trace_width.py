"""Power-rail trace-width observation: IPC-2221 ampacity of the thinnest
segment.

Pure geometry + the IPC-2221 formula (the inverse of ``akcli calc
trackwidth``, whose envelope rides in the evidence as the round-trip
oracle). Copper weight and temperature rise are assumptions and say so; the
finding stays an INFO observation because the rail's real current is not on
the board — the comparison against a known load lands with the power-tree
milestone.
