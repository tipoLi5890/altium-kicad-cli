"""Workspace write journal: `.akcli/journal.jsonl` next to the edited file.

The CLI is stateless per invocation, but an agent's work is a multi-step
session. Every write-path command (``plan``/``draw``/``arrange``/``undo``/
``relink-symbols``) appends one JSON line here so a later invocation — or a
harness hook — can answer "what was the last edit, was it applied, was there a
dry-run for this op-list, how deep is the undo stack" without re-deriving it.

Contract
--------
* One directory-level journal per workspace: ``<target-dir>/.akcli/journal.jsonl``.
  The ``.akcli/`` directory is the workspace state root; rotated draw backups
  live under ``.akcli/backups/`` (see :func:`backups_dir`).
* Append-only JSONL; every entry carries ``journal_version``/``ts`` (UTC ISO
  8601)/``cmd``/``target``/``status``. Readers skip corrupt lines.
* Write commands may attach a free-form ``note`` (``--note``) recording WHY
  an edit was made — design intent next to the mechanical record.
* Journaling **never fails the parent command**: any ``OSError`` degrades to a
  stderr note. ``AKCLI_JOURNAL=off`` disables writes entirely.
* Size-capped: past ``_MAX_BYTES`` the file rotates once to
  ``journal.jsonl.1`` (the tail of history survives, unbounded growth doesn't).
