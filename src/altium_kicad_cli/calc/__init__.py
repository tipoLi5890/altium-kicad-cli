"""``akcli calc`` — offline engineering calculators for circuit design.

Zero-dependency reimplementations from the primary sources (standards,
datasheets, textbooks) cited on every calculator. KiCad's ``pcb_calculator``
(GPLv3) was used **only** as an independent numerical cross-check in the test
suite — no KiCad code or text is included here.
