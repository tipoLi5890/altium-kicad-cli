"""Connectivity-hygiene checks (net-level, format-agnostic).

``run(sch, cfg) -> list[Finding]`` flags the classic "looks fine, isn't
connected" traps that graphical review misses:

* **NET_SINGLE_PIN** — a net with exactly one pin: either a floating label,
  a power port driving nothing, or a missing second connection. This is the
  net-level twin of KiCad's single-pin-net ERC.
* **NET_OFF_GRID** — component pins whose world coordinates are off the
  schematic grid. Off-grid pins are the canonical cause of wires that *touch*
  a pin on screen without ever joining its net.

Grid and coincidence policy
---------------------------
All comparisons are **exact integer nanometres** (``units.mil_to_nm``), never
rounded floats: two points COINCIDE only when their nm coordinates are equal
after the mil→nm rounding, which is the same quantisation the readers and the
writer gate use — so this check can neither claim a coincidence netbuild
rejects nor miss one it accepts. The grid comes from ``Config.grid_nm``
(``[project] grid`` — ``"50mil"`` default, metric values like ``"1.27mm"`` /
``"0.5mm"`` are exact in nm). A pin is off-grid when its nm residue exceeds
``_TOL_NM`` (0.5 mil): unit conversion noise is far below it, while a
genuinely misplaced pin (KiCad snaps exactly) is far above it.

Everything works on the normalized model, so Altium inputs are checked with
the same rules as KiCad ones.
