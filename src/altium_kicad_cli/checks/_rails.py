"""Shared rail-name heuristics for the ERC and power checks.

Kept in ONE place so the voltage-inference rules can't drift between ``erc.py`` and
``power.py`` (they used to carry identical copies — and an identical bug).

Boundary note: the trailing assertions use ``(?![0-9A-Za-z])`` rather than ``\\b``,
because ``_`` is a regex *word* character, so ``\\b`` does **not** treat ``V3V3_BNO``'s
trailing ``_`` as a boundary — that made underscore-suffixed rails (``V3V3_BNO``,
``V3V3_FSR``) fail to register as power, producing false ``ERC_NO_POWER``. The
digit-``V``-digit pattern deliberately has *no* leading assertion: in ``V3V3`` the
matched ``3`` is preceded by ``V``, so a leading boundary would wrongly reject it.
