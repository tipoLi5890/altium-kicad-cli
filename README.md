**akcli** is a zero-dependency Python CLI for **AI-native schematic design on KiCad** — a scriptable
design loop that you or **any AI agent** can drive end to end (bundled plugins/skills ship for Claude
Code, Codex, and OpenCode, but a shell is all it takes). Author a `.kicad_sch` from a JSON op-list,
run ERC / design-review / BOM / schematic ↔ PCB checks, simulate on ngspice, and source real
JLCPCB/LCSC parts. Existing Altium `.SchDoc` / `.SchLib` / `.PcbDoc` / `.PcbLib` designs import
read-only — an on-ramp into the KiCad flow, which is where all development happens.

## Install

Zero runtime dependencies; needs **Python ≥ 3.11** (for stdlib `tomllib`). The distribution is
`akcli-kicad`; the command is `akcli`:

```bash
pipx install akcli-kicad        # or: pip install akcli-kicad
akcli --version

# or run straight from a clone, no install
git clone https://github.com/tipoLi5890/akcli
./akcli/bin/akcli --help        # wrapper auto-selects a Python ≥ 3.11
```

Claude Code plugin (marketplace name `akcli`):

```text
/plugin marketplace add tipoLi5890/akcli
/plugin install akcli@akcli
```

Codex plugin (same name `akcli`):

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add tipoLi5890/akcli   # or `add ./` from a clone
codex plugin install akcli@akcli
```

Full details, per-agent setup, and troubleshooting in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Quickstart

Read a design, check it, and draw into it — straight from the shell:

```bash
akcli read  board.kicad_sch --summary                            # normalized JSON, context-budgeted
akcli check board.kicad_sch                                      # ERC-lite + power + BOM + connectivity
akcli draw  board.kicad_sch --ops ops.json                       # dry-run: shows changes + net diff
akcli draw  board.kicad_sch --ops ops.json --apply --strict-nets # atomic write + verify + backup
akcli undo  board.kicad_sch                                      # revert the last write
```

Every write is a dry run by default; `--apply` goes through an atomic snapshot → temp → verify →
replace pipeline with a pure-Python connectivity gate, and `akcli undo` reverts from a rotated backup
stack. Altium files are read-only offline.

## What it does

One normalized model behind every command, so each check, diff, and report works on a KiCad
`.kicad_sch` — and just the same on an imported Altium `.SchDoc`:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `read` · `net` · `component` · `pins` | Parse KiCad or Altium into one normalized JSON model; query nets, components, and pin coordinates. |
| `new` · `plan` · `draw` · `ops` · `arrange` | Author a `.kicad_sch` from a versioned **22-op + 10-macro** JSON op-list, behind a net-diff safety gate and one-command `undo`. |
| `check` · `verify` · `diff` · `pinmap` | ERC-lite + power + BOM + intent / contract checks, schematic ↔ PCB equivalence, net-membership diff, MCU pin → net map. |
| `review` | Advisory, confidence-graded design review across six detector families (signal / validation / pcb / emc / domain / gerber). |
| `sim` | Render to a SPICE deck and assert on KiCad's bundled ngspice; sweep corners; fit diode models from datasheet points. |
| `jlc` | Search JLCPCB/LCSC (stock, price, Basic/Extended), convert a part into a KiCad library in-process, fetch datasheets. |
| `calc` | **60** standards-cited offline calculators (E-series, IPC-2221, impedance, I²C pull-ups, buck/boost…), each citing its reference. |
| `library` · `fab` · `release` | Library-workspace audit/repair, versioned fab-profile checks, and a release preflight that writes a traceable manifest. |
| `render` · `doc` · `view` | Pure-stdlib SVG render, a Markdown pinout book, and a localhost `/calc` + `/live` dashboard. |

Two headline examples — a design review and a part search:

```bash
akcli review analyze board.kicad_sch --profile deep --pcb board.kicad_pcb   # advisory findings + evidence
akcli jlc search "0.1uF 0402 X7R"                                           # JLCPCB/LCSC catalog (needs network)
```

## Use with AI agents

`akcli` is a plain CLI, so any shell-capable agent can drive it. Commands emit structured JSON with
`--json` (carrying a `schema_version`), each op-list carries a `protocol_version`, and `akcli
capabilities` self-describes the entire CLI surface in one JSON document — and every error code ships a
machine-readable `remediation` hint.

- **Claude Code** — install the bundled plugin for five `/akcli:circuit-*` commands (review, pinmap,
  draw, diff, parts) plus twelve skills spanning design, review, authoring, Altium interop, parts
  sourcing, calculators, and release gating.
- **Codex** — install the bundled plugin, or drop the loose skill folders into `.agents/skills/` for
  auto-discovery. See [docs/codex-plugin.md](docs/codex-plugin.md).
- **OpenCode** — auto-discovers the bundled skills; see
  [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#use-with-ai-coding-agents) for the exact commands.

## Why akcli

- **Zero runtime dependencies.** Standard library only (including `tomllib`) — easy to vendor, sandbox,
  or run in CI.
- **Purpose-built for KiCad.** An iterative KiCad S-expression parser and byte-stable writer at the
  core; Altium designs come in read-only through pure-stdlib OLE2/CFBF record decoding, straight into
  the same KiCad flow. No compiled extensions.
- **Byte-identical re-apply.** Deterministic UUIDv5 + replace-in-place makes every edit idempotent —
  re-running an op-list produces the same bytes.
- **Connectivity is the only hard write gate.** Every `plan`/`draw` prints a before/after net diff
  (splits, merges, renames — matched by pin membership, never by name); `--strict-nets` refuses a
  write that splits or merges a named net.
- **Net inference you can trust.** A rebuilt net layer handles global same-name merges, junctions,
  T-junctions, and No-ERC markers — fixing the classic "same-named nets split into single-pin nets" bug.

## Optional external tools

"Zero-dependency" means zero Python **package** dependencies: `pip install` pulls in nothing, and the
entire core loop (read / plan / draw / check / diff / calc / render) runs on the standard library
alone. A few features can use something outside Python — always detected at runtime, never required
by the core loop:

| Feature | Uses | If missing |
|---|---|---|
| Advisory ERC second opinion, `view live` SVG | `kicad-cli` (local executable) | Skipped silently — non-fatal, results stay advisory. |
| `sim` execution (`--deck-only` needs nothing) | libngspice (bundled with KiCad) | `sim` exits with `NGSPICE_MISSING`; everything else unaffected. |
| `jlc` part search / datasheet fetch | Network | The **only** networked command family; all others are fully offline. |

`akcli doctor` probes each of these and prints per-OS remediation.

## Roadmap

**Shipped (v0.15.0):** KiCad write/draw from a 22-op + 10-macro vocabulary (hierarchical `add_sheet`,
net-diff safety rails, `new` / multi-level `undo`), net-preserving `arrange --groups` re-layout, the
advisory `akcli review` engine (six detector families, now including power-entry protection, plus a
datasheet facts store, `propose` / `tree` / `validate`), ERC / power / BOM / diff / pinmap / intent /
contract checks with waivers and SARIF, schematic ↔ PCB `verify`, a project `library` workspace,
versioned `fab` profiles, a `release preflight` gate, `akcli sim` on KiCad's bundled ngspice,
JLCPCB/LCSC sourcing with datasheet fetch, 60 standards-cited calculators, pure-stdlib SVG rendering,
and version-tolerant Altium/KiCad readers.

**Ahead (→ v1.0):** the contract-freeze audit. The first PyPI release (`pip install akcli-kicad`) shipped in 0.15.0.
*Deferred by decision:* a GitHub Action gating schematic PRs, the `view` waveform panel, and a native
MCP server (the plain CLI serves agents today). Full plan with exit criteria in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
