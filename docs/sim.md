# `akcli sim` — simulate a schematic and assert on the result

`akcli sim` turns a parsed schematic into a SPICE deck, runs it through
**libngspice** (the shared library that ships inside KiCad), reads back the
`.meas` measurements, and compares each one against a pass/fail bound you
declare in a `sim.json` file. The output is a measured-value table plus the same
[`Finding`](../src/altium_kicad_cli/report.py) records `akcli check` emits, so a
failed assertion is a normal non-zero exit you can gate CI on.

Nothing here needs KiCad's GUI or a `.cir` you hand-wrote: the deck is generated
from the same normalized net model the rest of the tool uses. If libngspice is
not installed you can still generate and inspect the deck (`--deck-only`).

```bash
# Emit the SPICE deck this schematic would simulate (no engine needed)
akcli sim board.kicad_sch --deck-only

# Run the assertions in sim.json and exit 1 if any fail
akcli sim board.kicad_sch --sim board.sim.json
```

## Architecture — the four stages

The command is a thin composition of four independent modules, each with a
pinned contract so they can be tested in isolation:

```
schematic (parsed, with inferred nets)
    │
    ▼
sim/deck.py     build(sch, spec) ─────────────► SPICE deck (one text string)
    │  · net  → SPICE node mapping                 · title line first
    │  · component → device (via models.resolve)   · elements, stimuli,
    │  · stimuli → V / I / B sources                 model cards, .analysis
    │  · unmodeled parts → warnings                 · .end last
    ▼
sim/engine.py   run(deck, commands) ───────────► child subprocess drives
    │  · spawns `python -m ...sim.engine`            libngspice via ctypes
    │  · feeds deck line-by-line (circbyline)        · SendChar → stdout
    │  · runs each analysis + its `meas ...`          · killed on timeout
    ▼
sim/assertions.py  run_commands(spec) ─────────► one analysis command per
    │               parse_meas_output(lines) ────►   configured analysis, each
    │               evaluate(spec, measured) ────►   followed by its meas lines
    ▼
commands/sim.py  measured-value table + findings + exit code
```

- **`sim/deck.py`** is the pure-text *value* layer. It never touches ngspice; it
  walks the schematic's nets, resolves each component to a `DeviceCard`, and
  renders one deck string. See [Model resolution](#model-resolution) below.
- **`sim/engine.py`** is the only stage that loads the shared library, and it
  does so **in a child subprocess** for crash isolation (a malformed deck can
  make ngspice call `abort()` on the whole process, and a pathological transient
  can spin forever). The parent kills the child on timeout and scrapes results
  from its stdout — it never raises for engine trouble.
- **`sim/assertions.py`** loads and validates `sim.json`, builds the engine
  command list (`run_commands`), parses ngspice's `SendChar` output back into
  numbers, and turns the comparison into `Finding`s.
- **`commands/sim.py`** wires the three together and renders the result.

> **Multi-analysis runs are dispatched per analysis.** A single `run` executes
> only the *first* dot-analysis in the deck, so a spec with more than one entry
> in `analyses` (e.g. `tran` **and** `ac`) would leave the second analysis's
> `.meas` with no plot to read — ngspice then prints `Error: meas ac …` and the
> whole run used to be misdiagnosed as an engine failure. `run_commands` instead
> issues one **interactive** analysis command per configured analysis
> (`tran …` / `ac …` / `op`), each immediately followed by the `meas` lines
> whose analysis resolves to it, so every measurement reads the plot its own
> analysis just produced. The deck still carries the `.tran`/`.ac` dot-cards for
> `--deck-only` portability; the engine just drives the analyses explicitly
> instead of relying on `run`.

---

## Engine discovery — where libngspice comes from

`sim/engine.available()` returns the first shared library it can actually
`dlopen`, searched in this order:

1. **`AKCLI_NGSPICE`** environment override. Set it to an absolute path to a
   libngspice shared object to force that one. Set it to `0`, `off`, `none`,
   `false`, or empty to **disable simulation entirely** (`available()` returns
   `None`, so `akcli sim --sim ...` exits `7`). An override path that will not
   load is a dead end — the search does **not** fall through to another library.
2. **macOS KiCad bundle** — `…/KiCad.app/Contents/PlugIns/sim/libngspice.0.dylib`
   and the `Frameworks/` variant.
3. **`ctypes.util.find_library("ngspice")`** — the platform loader's own search.
4. **Linux sonames** — `libngspice.so.0`, then `libngspice.so`.
5. **Windows KiCad** — newest `C:/Program Files/KiCad/*/bin/libngspice*.dll`.

Every candidate is verified by actually loading it, so a stale path never wins.
When nothing loads, `akcli sim` (run mode) prints
`ERROR: NGSPICE_MISSING: …` and exits `7`.

```bash
# Force a specific library
AKCLI_NGSPICE=/opt/ngspice/lib/libngspice.so.0 akcli sim board.kicad_sch --sim s.json

# Prove the engine-free plan path even on a machine that has KiCad
AKCLI_NGSPICE=off akcli sim board.kicad_sch --deck-only    # still works (no engine)
```

---

## `--deck-only` — the engine-free plan mode

`--deck-only` runs stages 1–2's *build* step and stops: it renders the deck and
exits `0` without ever touching libngspice. Use it to review exactly what would
be simulated, to hand a deck to another SPICE tool, or on a CI runner that has
no ngspice. Unmodeled/dangling warnings print to stderr but **never** fail
deck-only.

```bash
$ akcli sim board_v8.kicad_sch --deck-only
* akcli sim: board_v8.kicad_sch
R1 _3V3 MID 10k
R2 MID 0 10k
C1 MID 0 100n
.end
```

Write it to a file with `--out deck.cir`, or get a structured envelope with
`--json`:

```bash
$ akcli sim board_v8.kicad_sch --deck-only --json
{
  "deck_sha": "299eaa7e9ffd",
  "deck": "* akcli sim: board_v8.kicad_sch\nR1 _3V3 MID 10k\n…\n.end\n",
  "warnings": [],
  "unmodeled": []
}
```

`deck_sha` is a short SHA-1 of the deck text — a stable fingerprint you can use
to tell whether a schematic edit actually changed what gets simulated.

---

## `sim.json` — the assertion spec

The full format is validated both by
[`sim/assertions.load()`](../src/altium_kicad_cli/sim/assertions.py) and by
[`schemas/sim.schema.json`](../schemas/sim.schema.json) (draft 2020-12,
byte-identical mirror packaged under `src/altium_kicad_cli/schemas/`). Unknown
keys are rejected at every level.

```json
{
  "protocol_version": 1,
  "stimuli": [
    {"kind": "vsource", "name": "supply", "node": "+3V3", "node2": "0", "value": "dc 3.3"}
  ],
  "analyses": {"tran": "5u 100m", "ac": "dec 40 10 100k"},
  "models": {
    "D1": {"model_card": ".model DBAT D(IS=2.4e-8 N=1.05 RS=0.84 CJO=50p)", "model_name": "DBAT"}
  },
  "assert": [
    {"name": "vpeak", "meas": "MAX v(peak) from=20m to=60m", "gt": "0.35"},
    {"name": "t_detect", "when": "v(peak)=0.297 RISE=1", "lt": "25m"},
    {"name": "idle", "meas": "MAX v(peak) from=0 to=19m", "lt": "0.05"}
  ],
  "options": {}
}
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `protocol_version` | integer, **required**, `1` | Spec version. A value greater than this build understands raises `PROTOCOL_MISMATCH`. |
| `stimuli` | array of objects | Independent sources injected into the deck (see below). |
| `analyses` | object `str → str` | ngspice analysis name → its argument text, e.g. `{"tran": "5u 100m"}`. Rendered into the deck as `.tran 5u 100m`. |
| `models` | object | Per-device model overrides keyed by designator or `lib_id` (see [Model resolution](#model-resolution)). |
| `assert` | array of assert objects | The pass/fail checks (see below). |
| `options` | object | `extra_cards` (extra `.model`/`.subckt` text), `inline_analyses` (default `true`), `wave_vectors` (default `all`; an explicit list names the `--wave` CSV columns), `rshunt` (floating-node fix — see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting--floating-nodes-and-the-auto-rshunt-fix)). |

### Stimuli

Each stimulus becomes one source line in the deck. Every stimulus **must** carry
a `name` that is a bare identifier matching `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*$` and unique
across all stimuli — it becomes the SPICE element designator, so a missing name,
a leading digit (`"3V3"`), or an embedded space would corrupt the element line;
`load` rejects those with `BAD_CONFIG`. `node`/`node2` are matched against net
names (case-insensitively, via the net's names/aliases); `node2` defaults to
ground (`0`). A `node` that matches no net still emits (handy in `--deck-only`
mode) but raises a `SIM_UNKNOWN_STIMULUS_NODE` warning with close-match
suggestions so a typo is obvious.

| `kind` | Emits | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `vsource` | `V<name> n1 n2 <value>` | `value` e.g. `"dc 3.3"`, `"SIN(0 1 1k)"` |
| `isource` | `I<name> n1 n2 <value>` | `value` |
| `bsource` | `B<name> n1 n2 I=<expr>` | `quantity` (`I`/`V`, default `I`), `expr` |

> **Gotcha the deck builder absorbs for you:** a B-source expression has **all
> whitespace stripped** before it is emitted — libngspice's parser treats
> `I=expr` as a single token and mis-parses embedded spaces. Write
> `"0.2m + 0.1m*sin(2*pi*100*time)"` in the JSON and it lands as
> `I=0.2m+0.1m*sin(2*pi*100*time)`.

### Asserts

Each assert names exactly **one** measurement source and its bound(s).

- **Source** — either `meas` (verbatim text after `meas <analysis> <name>`, e.g.
  `"MAX v(peak) from=20m to=60m"`) or `when` (shorthand for a `WHEN`
  measurement, e.g. `"v(peak)=0.297 RISE=1"` → `meas <analysis> <name> WHEN
  v(peak)=0.297 RISE=1`). Supplying both, or neither, is a `BAD_CONFIG` error.
- **Bound** — a single one of `gt` / `lt` / `ge` / `le` / `approx`, **or** a
  two-sided range: one lower bound (`gt` *or* `ge`) together with one upper bound
  (`lt` *or* `le`) in the same entry, e.g. `{"ge": "3.0", "le": "3.6"}` for a
  3.3 V rail window. You may not pair two lowers (`gt`+`ge`) or two uppers
  (`lt`+`le`), and `approx` stays exclusive — it cannot be combined with any of
  the four inequalities. `approx` additionally accepts `tol` (relative, default
  `0.05` = 5%). When a two-sided assert fails, `evaluate()` names the side that
  was violated. Bound values accept engineering notation (`"25m"`, `"4.7k"`,
  `"1e-7"`) parsed with the same rules as `akcli calc`.
- **Analysis** — inferred automatically, or pinned with an explicit `analysis`
  key (which must name a configured analysis). Inference order:
  1. explicit `analysis` key;
  2. a `when` source, or a `from=`/`to=` window → `tran`;
  3. a `FIND … AT` measurement → `ac`, but **only if** the spec configures an
     `ac` analysis;
  4. otherwise → `tran`.

  If the inferred analysis was never configured in `analyses`, `load` fails with
  `BAD_CONFIG` — e.g. a `FIND v(mid) AT=0` assert against a spec that only
  declares `{"op": ""}` infers `tran` and is rejected until you add a `tran`
  analysis or set `"analysis": "op"` explicitly.

---

## Model resolution

Before the deck builder can emit an element line for a component, it asks
[`sim/models.resolve(comp, spec)`](../src/altium_kicad_cli/sim/models.py) what
SPICE primitive (if any) that component should become. The answer follows a
strict **first-hit-wins ladder**:

1. **`Sim.*` symbol fields** — the KiCad-native convention, the user's explicit
   intent. Recognized fields: `Sim.Device` (`R`/`C`/`L`/`D`/`Q`/`SUBCKT`/…),
   `Sim.Name` (model/subckt name), `Sim.Params` (value/parameters),
   `Sim.Pins` (SPICE-terminal → symbol-pin remap, e.g. `"1=2 2=1"`), and
   `Sim.Enable=0` to skip the part. A `Sim.Device=SUBCKT` / `Sim.Name` that names
   a builtin subcircuit pulls in its `.subckt` card automatically.
2. **`spec.models` override** — a `sim.json` entry keyed by designator (`"D1"`)
   or `lib_id`, carrying `device`, `params`/`value`, `model_card`, `model_name`,
   `pin_order`, or `skip`.
3. **Prefix + value heuristic** — `R`/`C`/`L` with a parseable value become
   passives; connectors / test-points / mechanical (`J`, `TP`, `MP`, `#…`, …)
   are skipped; **a diode, transistor, or IC with no model is returned
   `unmodeled` — never guessed at.** An unmodeled part is commented out of the
   deck and reported as a `SIM_UNMODELED` warning, so a missing model is loud,
   not a silent lie.

> **Diode/BJT terminal order comes from pin NAMES, not pin numbers.** SPICE node
> order is positional and semantic (`D <anode> <cathode>`, `Q <collector> <base>
> <emitter>`), but KiCad's stock symbols number diode pins `K`=1 / `A`=2 — so
> trusting pin *numbers* silently reverses polarity (an envelope/peak detector
> charges the wrong way). When a diode or transistor is emitted without an
> explicit `Sim.Pins`/`pin_order`, `resolve` reorders its terminals by pin
> **name** (`A`/`K`, `C`/`B`/`E`, case-insensitive). If the names cannot identify
> the terminals, it keeps schematic pin-number order and the deck emits a
> `SIM_PIN_ORDER_ASSUMED` warning — set `Sim.Pins` or a `spec.models` `pin_order`
> to fix the polarity.

### The `M`/`MEG` value fix (and other deck gotchas)

`spice_value()` (inside `models.py`) is where engineering notation becomes a
SPICE-safe value, and it resolves the notorious **`M` collision**: in the KiCad
values this tool reads, `M` means **mega** (a "1M" resistor is 1 MΩ), but in
SPICE `M` means **milli** and mega must be written `MEG`. The tool parses with
the mega meaning and renders SPICE `MEG`, so a `1M` resistor lands as `1MEG` and
a `25m` value stays `25m`. It also strips trailing unit words (`4.7kohm`,
`100nF`, `10uH`).

Two more hard-won gotchas the deck builder handles so you never see them:

- **Line 1 is a TITLE line.** ngspice always treats the first deck line as a
  comment/title, so the builder emits `* akcli sim: <source>` first and your
  real elements start on line 2.
- **`1M` means milli, mega is `1MEG`** — see above; centralized in
  `spice_value()` and never re-implemented in the deck builder.

### Fitting a diode from a datasheet — `fit_diode`

When a diode has no ready SPICE model, `models.fit_diode()` turns datasheet
forward-voltage points into a `.model` line you can paste into `spec.models`
(or `options.extra_cards`). It takes `(V_F, I_F)` points, an ideality prior
`n_prior` (default `1.05`, Schottky), an optional high-current `rs_point` for
series resistance, and an optional `cjo` junction capacitance. Every forward
point (and `rs_point`) must be positive and finite on both axes — a sign typo or
a swapped `V@I` (`1m@0.3`) is rejected with `BAD_CONFIG` rather than silently
producing a physically impossible model (negative or absurd `IS`). It is exposed on
the command line as **[`akcli sim fit-diode`](#akcli-sim-fit-diode--datasheet--spice-model)**
(below), which can also write the fitted model straight back onto a schematic.

**The table-beats-curve rule:** with a *single* datasheet point plus the
ideality prior, IS is solved directly. This is the deliberate, honest default —
because a two-point fit off eyeballed *curve* coordinates routinely lands IS
wildly wrong.

> ### ⚠️ The live IS-1000× story
> While modelling a BAT54H Schottky for the spiro rev C demod channel, a
> two-point fit taken from the datasheet's *I–V curve* (Fig. 2) produced
> `IS ≈ 1e-5` — about **1000× too large**. Its exaggerated reverse leakage
> drained the peak-detector hold cap every carrier period, so the simulated
> detector never latched. Re-fitting from the datasheet *table* row
> (`V_F ≤ 0.37 V @ I_F = 20 mA`) with the Schottky prior `N = 1.05` gave
> `IS ≈ 2.4e-8` and a working channel. **When the datasheet gives you a table
> row, use it; treat curve coordinates as eyeball-grade.** `fit_diode` attaches
> a `note` warning whenever a multi-point fit's `N` is clamped or disagrees with
> the prior by more than 30%.

## Output and exit codes

In **run mode** the text output is a metadata header (engine path + short deck
SHA-1), an always-printed measured-value table, then the findings:

```
# akcli sim
  engine: /Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/PlugIns/sim/libngspice.0.dylib
  deck sha1: 92b66c254cc8

measured values:
  mid                              1.65   ~1.65 (tol 2%)         PASS

# metadata
  ...                                       (standard report metadata block)
# findings (0)
  (none)
```

`--json` returns `{deck_sha, engine, measured, findings, ok}`.

### `--wave OUT.csv` — the clean waveform CSV

`--wave OUT.csv` writes the simulated vectors to a **tidy CSV**: a single scale
column followed by one verbatim column per vector, in the order requested. ngspice's
raw `wrdata` format repeats the scale in front of *every* vector (`t v1 t v2 …`);
`sim/wave.rewrite_wrdata()` collapses those redundant scale columns into one. The
scale column is labelled `time` for a transient/op run and `frequency` for an `ac`
analysis (with multiple analyses, `--wave` captures the last one, and the label
tracks it). Column names come from an explicit `options.wave_vectors` list — that
list *is* the CSV header — so for named columns you must set it:

```bash
akcli sim board.kicad_sch --sim board.sim.json --wave wave.csv
```

```
time,v(MID)
0.00000000e+00,1.65000000e+00
1.00000000e-07,1.65000000e+00
2.00000000e-07,1.65000000e+00
…
```

With no explicit `wave_vectors` (the `all` default, where ngspice chooses the
column set and their names are not known ahead of time) the raw `wrdata` file is
moved through verbatim instead of being re-shaped. A `--wave` path containing
spaces is handled (ngspice `wrdata`s to a fixed name, then the file is moved).

| Exit | When |
|---|---|
| `0` | All assertions passed (or `--exit-zero`, or `--deck-only`). |
| `1` | At least one assertion failed or a measurement never produced a result. |
| `2` | Usage/config error — neither `--sim` nor `--deck-only` given, or a `BAD_CONFIG` in `sim.json`. |
| `4` | `sim.json` file not found. |
| `6` | Deck build failure — `SIM_NO_GROUND` (no ground net; pass `--gnd <net>`) or `SIM_NODE_COLLISION` (two nets sanitize to the same node), or a `PROTOCOL_MISMATCH`. |
| `7` | libngspice missing (`NGSPICE_MISSING`) or an engine failure/timeout (`NGSPICE_FAILED`). A deck that ngspice cannot parse (e.g. `Error: circuit not parsed.`) is an engine failure: the run exits `7` with the parse error on stderr — it is never mistaken for a clean pass, even for a zero-assertion spec. |

`--exit-zero` forces `0` even when assertions fail (useful for reporting-only
runs). Deck `WARNING`-severity findings (unmodeled parts, dangling pins) render
but never change the exit code.

Findings raised by the sim pipeline:

| Code | Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SIM_ASSERT_FAIL` | ERROR | Measurement ran but violated its bound. |
| `SIM_MEAS_FAILED` | ERROR | The measurement itself failed (e.g. a `WHEN` edge that never crossed) or produced no result. |
| `SIM_UNMODELED` | WARNING | A component had no SPICE model and was omitted from the deck. |
| `SIM_DANGLING_PIN` | WARNING | A pin sat on no net; tied to a unique `NC_<ref>_<pin>` node. |
| `SIM_BAD_STIMULUS` | WARNING | A stimulus had an unknown `kind` and was skipped. |
| `SIM_PIN_ORDER_ASSUMED` | WARNING | A diode/transistor's pin names could not identify the SPICE terminal order; it was emitted in schematic pin-number order — verify polarity. |
| `SIM_UNKNOWN_STIMULUS_NODE` | WARNING | A stimulus `node` matched no net; a new dangling node was created (suggestions offered). |
| `SIM_FLOATING_NODE` | WARNING | A net has no DC path to ground (only a cap/nothing left after skips) — ngspice would return a singular matrix. Auto-`rshunt` (below) makes it solvable. |
| `SIM_UNDRIVEN_RAIL` | WARNING | A power-named net (`+*`/`VCC*`/`VDD*`/`VBAT*`/`VSUP*`) has no voltage-source drive while the spec has stimuli — a silent read-≈0 trap (forgot the rail source). |
| `SIM_RSHUNT_ADDED` | NOTE | Auto-`rshunt` appended `.option rshunt=1e12` because a floating node was found. Below WARNING, so it never changes the exit code. |
| `SIM_SWEEP_IGNORED` | WARNING | A `--sweep` component-value override has no effect because that part's SPICE card resolves from `Sim.Params` / `spec.models` / a device model, not its component value — every corner would be identical. |

## `akcli sim fit-diode` — datasheet → SPICE model

The library `fit_diode()` (above) is exposed as a subcommand: run
`akcli sim fit-diode` with one or more datasheet forward-voltage `--point V@I`
values and it prints the fitted `.model` card plus the matching `Sim.Params`
string. Every value takes engineering notation, and the `V@I` point syntax is a
forward voltage, `@`, a forward current (`0.37@20m` = 0.37 V at 20 mA).

```bash
# One table row + the Schottky prior → IS solved directly (the honest default)
akcli sim fit-diode --point 0.37@20m --n-prior 1.05 --name DBAT
```

```
# akcli sim fit-diode

.model DBAT D(IS=2.4034e-08 N=1.0500)

Sim.Params: IS=2.4034e-08 N=1.0500
```

Add `--rs-point V@I` (a high-current point) to solve series resistance `RS`, and
`--cjo F` (e.g. `50p`) for junction capacitance. `--json` returns
`{name, model_card, sim_params, params, note}` — `note` carries the fit warning
when a multi-point `N` is clamped or disagrees with the prior.

### Writing the fit back onto a schematic — the datasheet → model loop

`--apply SCH --designator REF` closes the loop from a sourced part to a
ready-to-simulate schematic: it plans a native `set_component_parameters` write
that stamps `Sim.Device` + `Sim.Params` (and `Sim.Name` when a model name is
carried) onto that component, so the very next `akcli sim` run resolves it via
the [`Sim.*` first-hit-wins ladder](#model-resolution). It is a **dry run by
default** — it prints the exact op-list it *would* apply and changes nothing:

```bash
akcli sim fit-diode --point 0.37@20m --name DBAT \
  --apply board.kicad_sch --designator D4          # dry-run: prints the op-list
```

```
# akcli sim fit-diode (dry-run)

.model DBAT D(IS=2.4034e-08 N=1.0500)

would set on D4 in board.kicad_sch:
{
  "protocol_version": 1,
  "target_format": "kicad",
  "ops": [
    {
      "op": "set_component_parameters",
      "designator": "D4",
      "parameters": {
        "Sim.Device": "D",
        "Sim.Params": "IS=2.4034e-08 N=1.0500"
      }
    }
  ]
}

re-run with --write to apply (writes board.kicad_sch.bak; `akcli undo` reverts)
```

Add `--write` to commit through the KiCad writer (rotated `.bak`, connectivity
re-verify; a failed apply exits `6`).

> **The applied fit round-trips into a working deck.** The op-list above writes
> only `Sim.Device=D` + `Sim.Params` (no `Sim.Name`). When the next `akcli sim`
> resolves that component, `models.resolve` sees a native device carrying inline
> parameters but no model to point at, so it **synthesizes** a deterministic
> model name (`AKCLI_<designator>`) and a matching `.model` card from the
> `Sim.Params` (`D → .model AKCLI_D4 D(IS=… N=…)`; `NPN`/`PNP` likewise). The
> element line and its model card are emitted together, so a `fit-diode
> --apply --write` result simulates as-is — the diode conducts — instead of
> emitting a modelless element that ngspice rejects with `circuit not parsed`.

This is the last leg of the full
datasheet-to-model workflow: **source the part → grab its datasheet PDF → read
off the forward-voltage table row → `fit-diode --apply --write`**. The first two
legs are the parts commands — see [`docs/jlc.md` §`jlc datasheet`](jlc.md) and
the **parts-sourcing** skill for pulling the datasheet, and the **design-calc**
skill for the surrounding component-value math.

## `--sweep` — corner matrices

`--sweep NAME=v1,v2,…` re-runs the whole simulate-and-assert pass across a
**Cartesian matrix** of corners and prints a per-corner verdict table. Each
`--sweep` is one axis; the flag is repeatable and the product is capped at **64**
corners. Two axis kinds are recognized:

- **Component-value override** — `R21=2.2k,3.3k` swaps that designator's value on
  a deep copy of the schematic before the deck is rebuilt (nothing on disk
  changes).
- **Temperature** — `temp=0,25,60` injects a `.option temp=<v>` line into the
  deck for each value.

```bash
akcli sim divider.kicad_sch --sim divider.sim.json --sweep R1=10k,20k
```

```
# akcli sim (sweep: 2 corner(s))
  engine: /Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/PlugIns/sim/libngspice.0.dylib

corner  R1   vmid  verdict
------  ---  ----  -------
1       10k  1.65  PASS
2       20k  1.1   FAIL

corners: 1/2 passed
```

The run exits `1` if **any** corner fails an assertion (or `0` with
`--exit-zero`). `--json` returns `{engine, corners: [{params, measured, ok,
findings}], warnings, ok}`. `--sweep` is engine-only: it is a usage error
together with `--deck-only`, without `--sim`, or with `--wave`.

**Deck-build diagnostics are surfaced in sweep mode too.** Single-run mode prints
the deck-build warnings (`SIM_FLOATING_NODE`, `SIM_RSHUNT_ADDED`,
`SIM_UNMODELED`, `SIM_UNDRIVEN_RAIL`, …); sweep mode used to drop them, so an
auto-inserted `rshunt` could mask a real wiring error in exactly the sign-off
mode. Each corner's warnings are now gathered, deduped, and rendered under the
corner table (and in the `warnings` array of `--json`). A **component** sweep
whose value the deck will silently ignore — because the part resolves through
`Sim.Params`, a `spec.models` entry, or a D/Q/X device model rather than its
component value — raises a `SIM_SWEEP_IGNORED` warning instead of producing a
matrix of byte-identical corners with no notice.

## Worked example — a resistor divider (self-contained)

The `board_v8` fixture is a 10 kΩ / 10 kΩ divider between `+3V3` and ground,
with a 100 nF cap on the midpoint. Drive `+3V3` with 3.3 V and assert the
midpoint sits at half-rail:

```json
{
  "protocol_version": 1,
  "stimuli": [
    {"kind": "vsource", "name": "supply", "node": "+3V3", "node2": "0", "value": "dc 3.3"}
  ],
  "analyses": {"tran": "10u 1m"},
  "assert": [
    {"name": "mid", "meas": "MAX v(mid) from=0 to=1m", "approx": "1.65", "tol": "0.02"}
  ]
}
```

```
$ akcli sim board_v8.kicad_sch --sim divider.sim.json
# akcli sim
  engine: /Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/PlugIns/sim/libngspice.0.dylib
  deck sha1: 92b66c254cc8

measured values:
  mid                              1.65   ~1.65 (tol 2%)         PASS

# metadata
  ...                                       (standard report metadata block)
# findings (0)
  (none)
$ echo $?
0
```

> **Node names must match after sanitizing.** The net is named `+3V3`; the deck
> sanitizes it to node `_3V3`. The stimulus `node` field is matched against the
> *net* name (`+3V3`), so use `"+3V3"` there — using `"3V3"` would create a new,
> floating node and the divider would read 0 V.

## Worked example — the spiro rev C demod channel

The reference the sim stack was built against is an IR photodiode demodulation
channel: a `TCRT5000`-driven photocurrent (ambient DC + 100 Hz flicker + a
gated ~2 kHz carrier while a ball passes), a high-pass front end, and a
`BAT54H` peak detector with a hold cap and bleed resistor. Simulated over a
100 ms transient with the datasheet-fitted `BAT54H` model (`IS ≈ 2.4e-8`,
`N = 1.05`, `RS ≈ 0.84 Ω`, `CJO = 50 pF` — see the [IS-1000× box](#fitting-a-diode-from-a-datasheet--fit_diode)),
the channel's assertions come out as:

| Measurement | Meas / when | Bound | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `t_detect` | `WHEN v(peak)=0.297 RISE=1` | `< 25m` | **2.3 ms** — detector latches well within budget |
| `vpeak` | `MAX v(peak) from=20m to=60m` | `> 0.35` | **0.49 V** — carrier envelope during the pass |
| `idle` | `MAX v(peak) from=0 to=19m` | `< 0.05` | **39 mV** — quiescent baseline before the ball |

That is the whole point of `akcli sim`: the design intent ("the detector must
latch inside 25 ms and idle below 50 mV") is written down as machine-checkable
bounds, and a schematic edit that breaks them turns into a non-zero exit instead
of a surprise on the bench.

## Worked example — a closed-loop comparator channel

A more involved reference: a **single-channel non-inverting Schmitt peak-detector
comparator**, built entirely from the pieces above (passives, a datasheet-fitted
Schottky, and the packaged `AKCLI_COMPARATOR` builtin subcircuit). It exercises
the `spec.models` `pin_order` path, positive-feedback hysteresis, and the
`.options method=gear` integration escape hatch.

**Topology.** A `bsource` drives node `HP` with an amplitude-triangle 50 kHz
carrier; a BAT54-style Schottky `D1` (anode `HP`, cathode `PEAK`) rectifies into a
peak-hold `R3` (100k) ‖ `C1` (10n) [RC = 1 ms] on `PEAK`; `PEAK` reaches the
comparator summing node `SUMM` through `R4` (100k); `R5` (1 MEG) feeds `OUT` back to
`SUMM` (positive-feedback hysteresis); `R1` (40k) / `R2` (10k) divider sets
`VREF ≈ 1.0 V`; `R6` (10k) is the open-collector pull-up `VCC → OUT`.

> **The comparator-sense gotcha.** `AKCLI_COMPARATOR` (ports `inp inn out vcc`)
> **sinks `OUT` low when `inp > inn`** — the *opposite* sense to a real LM339
> (which sinks when IN− > IN+). So the physical non-inverting (+) input maps to the
> model's `inn`, and the reference to `inp`. The `pin_order` encodes exactly this.
> The resistor designators must be **numeric-suffixed** (`R1`, not `Rt`) or the
> passive prefix heuristic rejects them, and the loop needs
> `.options method=gear` — trapezoidal integration hits "Timestep too small at
> vsup#branch" at the release edge (~7.6 ms) and aborts; gear converges over the
> full 10 ms.

The `sim.json` (`protocol_version 1`):

```json
{
  "protocol_version": 1,
  "stimuli": [
    {"kind": "vsource", "name": "Vsup", "node": "VCC", "node2": "0", "value": "5"},
    {"kind": "bsource", "name": "Bdrv", "node": "HP", "node2": "0", "quantity": "V",
     "expr": "2*(1-abs(time-5m)/5m)*sin(3.14159e5*time)"}
  ],
  "analyses": {"tran": "1u 10m"},
  "models": {
    "U1": {"device": "X", "model_name": "AKCLI_COMPARATOR", "pin_order": ["4", "5", "2", "3"]},
    "D1": {"device": "D", "model_name": "DBAT", "model_card": ".model DBAT D(IS=2.4e-8 N=1.05 RS=0.1)"}
  },
  "options": {"extra_cards": [".options method=gear"]}
}
```

`U1`'s symbol pins are `5`=IN+, `4`=IN−, `2`=OUT, `3`=V+; `pin_order`
`["4","5","2","3"]` is the model's `[inp, inn, out, vcc]` terminal order, i.e.
`VREF(inp) SUMM(inn) OUT VCC`. The diode order `HP → PEAK` is name-derived (pins
`A`/`K`), not from `pin_order`. The resulting deck contains **exactly one**
X-element:

```
D1 HP PEAK DBAT
R1 VCC VREF 40k
R2 VREF 0 10k
R3 PEAK 0 100k
R4 PEAK SUMM 100k
R5 OUT SUMM 1MEG
R6 VCC OUT 10k
C1 PEAK 0 10n
XU1 VREF SUMM OUT VCC AKCLI_COMPARATOR
Vsup VCC 0 5
Bdrv HP 0 V=2*(1-abs(time-5m)/5m)*sin(3.14159e5*time)
```

Live over `tran 1u 10m` (libngspice 45.2 in the KiCad bundle, reproducible): the
channel idles `OUT` LOW (`vout_lo = 0.005 V`, `peak_idle = 0.022 V < VREF`), snaps
`OUT` HIGH on detect (`vout_hi = 4.969 V`) with a 10–90% rise of **0.81 µs**
(≈1200× faster than the 1 ms RC — regenerative), and shows a hysteresis band of
**0.431 V** (attack 1.199 V − release 0.768 V). That band tracks the non-inverting
Schmitt prediction `ΔV_in = ΔV_out·(R4/R5) = 4.964·0.1 = 0.496 V` to within 13%.

## Troubleshooting — floating nodes and the auto-`rshunt` fix

Skipping ICs (`spec.models: {"U6": {"skip": true}}`) can leave nets whose only
remaining connection is a capacitor — a 555's CV pin with just its 10 n cap, a
regulator input holding only its bulk cap. At DC such a node is **floating**, the
operating point becomes a *singular matrix*, every gmin/source-stepping rescue
fails, and ngspice starts the transient from an unconverged state: the first
~100 µs show a phantom start-up ramp that can charge peak detectors and flip
time-based assertions (a `WHEN ... RISE=1` firing at microseconds is the tell-tale).

**The deck builder now detects and fixes this automatically.** Any net with no DC
path to ground is reported `SIM_FLOATING_NODE` (WARNING, naming the components that
stranded it), and — under the default `rshunt` policy — the builder appends
`.option rshunt=1e12` to make the operating point solvable, noting it with a
`SIM_RSHUNT_ADDED` NOTE (below WARNING, so it never changes the exit code).
`rshunt` hangs a 1 TΩ resistor from every node to ground: invisible to the
electrical results, but the matrix is no longer singular. So in most cases you no
longer need to do anything — the phantom ramp simply goes away.

`options.rshunt` controls the policy:

| `rshunt` value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| absent / `"auto"` (default) | Append `.option rshunt=1e12` **only when** ≥1 floating node is found (emits `SIM_RSHUNT_ADDED`). |
| `false` | **Never** emit it — you keep the raw singular matrix (and the `SIM_FLOATING_NODE` warning). |
| a number or string (`1e12`, `"1G"`) | **Always** emit exactly that value, floating node or not. |

The manual override still works if you want to pin a specific value or add other
cards — `options.extra_cards` is a raw passthrough:

```json
"options": {"extra_cards": [".option rshunt=1e12"]}
```

(Live validation: the spiro rev C channel reproduced its reference simulation to
six significant figures once the two cap-only nets left behind by skipping the 555
and the regulator were shunted — which auto-`rshunt` now does on its own.)
